# Predictive Modeling for Cost Effective Solutions

## Overview
This repository hosts a sophisticated regression model meticulously developed to address the critical challenges in Bit Error Rate (BER) testing of Differential Pair cables. The model focuses on accurately predicting the bias and error introduced by newly implemented, cost-effective testing equipment. By leveraging a diverse dataset comprising BER eye measurements obtained from both conventional and modern testing apparatus, this model aims to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of BER testing procedures.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this regression model is to mitigate the limitations associated with older testing equipment, which often deteriorates over time and lacks the capacity to effectively test various types of cables. By modeling the behavior of the new testing equipment and its impact on BER testing results, this model ensures the accuracy and consistency of test outcomes, thereby bolstering confidence in the performance and reliability of Differential Pair cables.

## Methodology
The development of the regression model involved meticulous data collection from multiple Differential Pair cables subjected to BER testing using both old and new testing equipment. The dataset primarily consists of BER eye measurements, which serve as the foundation for training and validating the regression model. Through rigorous analysis and application of advanced regression techniques, the model is adept at predicting the bias and error introduced by the new testing equipment with remarkable precision.

## Data Description
The dataset used for training and evaluating the regression model encompasses a diverse array of BER eye measurements obtained from Differential Pair cables tested under varying conditions. This comprehensive dataset facilitates a thorough understanding of the performance characteristics of the cables and enables the model to discern patterns and trends associated with different testing equipment. By leveraging this rich dataset, the regression model can effectively generalize its predictions to new testing scenarios and cable types.
